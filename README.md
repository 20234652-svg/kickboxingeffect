                <center><h1>EFFECTS OF KICKBOXING</h1><br>
                    <HR>
                    <h2>SELF DEFENCE</h2> 
                    Nobody wants to be bullied in school, or even worse, in adulthood and nobody wants to be robbed in the street.  
                    Nobody also wants to be confronted in a dark alleyway without the means to defend themselves.  Kickboxing is a very 
                    versatile martial art that teaches you many basics, especially when it comes to striking with your hands and legs.  
                    Having the ability to protect yourself is a valuable asset and its empowering to know that if you were in a dangerous situation, 
                    you have the knowledge to help get yourself out of it safely.<br>
                
                    <br><H2>BUILDING STRONGER MUSCLE</H2>
                    There is a lot more than just striking when you engage in martial arts like kickboxing. 
                    Training for this fantastic martial art means doing many different exercises, like sit ups, push ups, body strength exercises, 
                    using skipping ropes and so much more. Kickboxing allows you to become strong very quickly.  All of that striking that you do with your 
                    legs and your hands definitely uses your muscles.Kickboxing is great because the sport itself plus all of the training that you do for it will strengthen, 
                    condition and tone up your body.Kickboxing is especially beneficial for your arms, legs and core, but it is also great for all of your other muscles too. 
                    Not only will your muscles be stronger, but they will also be more toned as well, giving you good muscle definition.<br>

                    <br><h2>STRESS RELIEVER</h2>
                    Kickboxing is a great way to relieve anger and stress. Life can be pretty stressful, 
                    not to mention that daily events can cause a whole lot of anxiety and depression, but not to worry because those are all things that kickboxing 
                    can take care of with ease.  Hitting and kicking a punching bag has now proved to be quite helpful in meeting anger and stress.   
                    Whatâ€™s more, this technique is far better and a much healthier way to deal with your anger, because, at the end of the day, its a form of exercise. 
                    So yes, you get to combine physical and mental stress and get rid of it in a healthy way.  Feelings of happiness and relaxation are a big part of exercising 
                    on a regular basis. <br>

                    <br><h2>IMPROVED FLEXIBILITY AND BALANCE</h2>
                    Building flexibility over time is great because it helps you avoid injuries in your everyday life. 
                    Another really great thing that kickboxing can do for you is to help increase your flexibility and it is not only what you do during the training, 
                    but what you also do before and after the training.   Stretching is very important and it makes you more limber not only for your next kickboxing class, 
                    but it also helps keep you flexible in general.Being more flexible is good for other things too, such as being a better fighter in kickboxing.  
                    There is also the fact that being more flexible also leads to better balance so you are more likely to prevent slips and falls and injuries if you have 
                    better balance.<BR>

                    <BR><H2>INCREASED ENDURANCE AND PHYSICAL OUTPUT</H2>
                    Another great benefit that you get from doing kickboxing is that it can help increase your stamina, endurance, and your overall ability to perform physical activities.

                    First off, all of the strength training and muscle toning that kickboxing involves will increase your ability to lift heavy things.
                        
                    More blood circulating to your muscles means that they also receive more nutrients, vitamins and proteins, all things which they need to keep functioning. The more of these things your muscles get, the longer and harder they can function for, which is required for stamina and endurance.
